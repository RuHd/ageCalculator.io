AGE CALCULATOR SOLUTION

Surprisingly, the css was the hardest to me than the functionality itself. I spent a decent amount of time to figure out the best way to organize all the containers and to establish each position on the page. But despite the struggle, it was really fun to solve. There's some traits that it's missing but in overall, I'm happy with! Hope you like it! :)
